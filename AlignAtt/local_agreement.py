    Ensures local agreement between the new theory and the previous theory by
    extending the stable theory with tokens that match within a specified range.

    Args:
        new_theory (list): The current hypothesis or generated tokens.
        previous_theory (list): The previous hypothesis or generated tokens.
        stable_theory (list): The stable hypothesis that has been agreed upon so far.

            `local_agreement_length` attribute, which specifies the number of tokens
            to check for agreement.

        list: The updated stable theory after applying local agreement.
